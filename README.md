# R-Project-2024

Project 1:
For my R assignment, I primarily worked on analyzing COVID-19 data by loading multiple CSV files and using the tidyverse package for data manipulation. I focused on visualizing various trends, including daily vaccinations, confirmed cases, active cases, and regional COVID trends. I utilized packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and zoo to clean the data, calculate rolling averages, and create informative plots. These plots, such as bar and line charts, were then customized using themes and labels to illustrate key insights, like vaccination rates and active cases, over specific timeframesâ€‹

Project 3:
In Assignment 3, I performed a comprehensive text analysis of academic publications from 2011 to 2020. After loading and cleaning the dataset, I focused on identifying the most commonly used words in abstracts and titles, with "information," "research," and "study" appearing frequently. I also created a visual treemap to illustrate the prominence of specific index keywords such as "Information Systems." Additionally, I applied sentiment analysis to determine the average sentiment of the articles, showing a positive general tone. Further analyses included identifying the top 10 most productive and most cited authors, with Thong J.Y.L. being a prominent figure. Finally, I ran a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to uncover thematic structures in the articles, which highlighted key topics related to information and research.
